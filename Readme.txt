To create a user and set a password automatically in Ubuntu using a Python script along with bash commands, you can combine subprocess calls to execute the necessary commands. Hereâ€™s an example Python script that accomplishes this:

1. Python file (create_user.py):

This script will create a new user and set a password using bash commands.





How this script works:

1. subprocess.run(): Runs a shell command from within Python. In this case, it creates a user using useradd and sets the password using chpasswd.


2. -m flag: Ensures that the user's home directory is created.


3. chpasswd: Sets the password for the user.



How to run:

1. Save the Python script (create_user.py).


2. Give it execution permission:



chmod +x create_user.py

3. Run the script using sudo:



sudo python3 create_user.py

This will create the user and set the password as specified in the script.






Steps to execute:

1. Save this script as create_user.py.


2. Make it executable:

chmod +x create_user.py



3. Run the script with sudo:

sudo python3 create_user.py
